    "What is COVID-19?",
    "COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions\u00a0are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience\u00a0more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines\u00a0against COVID-19 are safe and effective."

    "Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?",
    "On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced\u00a0an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, \u201cCO\u201d stands for corona, \u201cVI\u201d for virus, and \u201dD\u201d for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV.\u201d"

    "How does the virus spread?",
    "COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet). People who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. Cases of reinfection with COVID-19 \u00a0have been reported but are rare. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes.\nCOVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads from person to person can vary. The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread more efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses known to affect people.\nFor more information about how COVID-19 spreads, visit the How COVID-19 Spreads\u00a0page to learn how COVID-19 spreads and how to protect yourself.\u00a0"

However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people. Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19."

    "Is hunter-harvested game meat safe to eat during the COVID-19 pandemic?",
    "Currently, there is no evidence that you can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 by eating food, including wild hunted game meat. However, hunters can get infected with other diseases when processing or eating game.\u00a0 Hunters should always practice good hygiene when processing animals by following these food safety recommendations:\n\nDo not harvest animals that appear sick or are found dead.\nKeep game meat clean and cool the meat down as soon as possible after harvesting the animal.\nAvoid cutting through the backbone and spinal tissues and do not eat the brains of any wild animal.\nWhen handling and cleaning game:\n\nWear rubber or disposable gloves.\nDo not eat, drink, or smoke.\n\n\nWhen finished handling and cleaning game:\n\nWash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\nClean knives, equipment, and surfaces that were in contact with game meat with soap and water and then disinfect them. While these recommendations apply to general food safety practices, if you are concerned about COVID-19, you may use a product on the EPA list of disinfectants for use against the COVID-19 virusexternal icon.\n\n\nCook all game meat thoroughly (to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F or higher).\nCheck with your state wildlife agency regarding any testing requirements for other diseases and for any specific instructions regarding preparing, transporting, and consuming game meat.\n\n"

    "How can I safely run my equestrian facility?",
    "You should follow your state and/or local jurisdictional guidance regarding continuing operations at your facility. There have not been any reports of horses testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. COVID-19 is primarily spread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for people visiting your facility.\n\nEncourage employees and other visitors, including boarders, owners, farriers, veterinarians, and those taking lessons, not to enter the facility if they are sick. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation\u00a0are met, after talking with their doctor. Implement sick leave policies that are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection.\nConsider conducting daily health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees and others visiting the facility before they enter the premises. People with a fever of 100.40(38.00C) or above or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the premises. If implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully. See General Business FAQs\u00a0for more information.\n\nEmployees or visitors who appear to have symptoms upon arrival or who become sick during their visit should immediately be separated from other employees and visitors and sent home.\n\n\nLimit the number of people entering the facility. Consider staggering lesson and visiting times to limit the number of people in the facility and potential for person-to-person contact. If possible, you can also take steps to decrease high-traffic areas by limiting areas open to visitors/owners or staggering use of common areas like grooming or wash stalls and tack rooms.\nIncrease distance and limit duration of contact between employees and visitors in the facility. Whenever possible, people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other at the facility, including instructors teaching lessons. Allow for social distancing\u00a0and avoid large numbers of people within the facility, including in employee-only areas.\nVisitors and employees should wear masks especially where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Masks offer some protection to the wearer and are also meant to protect those around the wearer, in case they are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Wearing a mask does NOT replace the need to practice social distancing.\nSet up hand hygiene stations at the entrance and within the facility, so that employees and people entering can clean their hands before they enter. Employees should wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can be used, but if hands are visibly dirty, they should be washed with soap and water before using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Examples of hand hygiene stations may be a hose and soap located at entrances to allow for handwashing before entry.\nCleaning high touch surfaces and shared objects once a day is usually enough\u00a0to sufficiently remove virus that may be on surfaces unless someone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in the equestrian facility.\u00a0Disinfecting (using disinfectants on\u00a0U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\u2019s List Nexternal icon) removes any remaining germs on surfaces, which further reduces any risk of spreading infection.\u00a0\u00a0For more information on cleaning regularly and cleaning when someone is sick, see Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Facility.\nFollow local guidance on shelter in place and travel recommendations when traveling for showing, training, or trail riding.\nIf traveling to a new facility, limit contact between people, horses, tack, equipment, and other supplies from different facilities, and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between horses and riders.\n\nFollow state and local guidance on travel. People who are sick should not travel to other facilities.\nPeople visiting other facilities should follow the same precautions as they would normally, including maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between each other, wearing a mask to protect others, and washing hands frequently with soap and water.\n\n\nIf other animals, such as barn cats, are present at the facility, be aware that a small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.\n\nFor more information, see Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19 pdf icon[35 pages, 1.4mb]external icon\u00a0and Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)."

    "Can the virus that causes COVID-19 get back into the environment from wastewater and infect wildlife?",
    "SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) can be shed in the feces of people with COVID-19. Genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 has been found in untreated wastewater. However, while data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater, and no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater. It is possible that wildlife could become infected with SARS-CoV-2 from contact with untreated wastewater, but evidence from studies of virus infectivity in feces and survival in wastewater suggests that this transmission route is unlikely to occur."

    "What are community mitigation actions for COVID-19?",
    "There are several actions that individuals and communities can take to help reduce the chance that they, their families and friends, and their communities get COVID-19. In general, the more cases spreading in your community, the more likely it will spread to you or your family. Also, the more people an individual interacts with, and the longer each interaction lasts, the higher the risk of viral spread. Location can be a factor, too, with outdoor activities generally being less risky than indoor activities.\n\u00a0Individuals can take the following community mitigation actions:\n\nWear a mask (with some exceptions) when in public settings or around others not living in the same household\nFollow healthy hygiene practices, such as frequent hand washing\nPractice social distancing\nStay home when sick\nClean frequently touched surfaces daily\n\nCommunities can take the following actions:\n\nPromote behaviors that prevent spread\nMaintain healthy environments\nEnsure institutions in the community are practicing appropriate precautions\nPrepare for when someone gets sick\nClose businesses and schools, and limit other services\n\nFor more information, see Community Guidance, Community Mitigation, and Community Mitigation Framework."

There has not been any confirmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. However, they think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)."

If an in-water rescue is needed, minimize exposure to the distressed swimmer\u2019s face without protection, if possible approaching him or her from behind.\n\n\n\n\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)\n\nFor practice resuscitation\n\nLimit student-to-manikin ratio and student-to-automated external defibrillator (AED) training device ratio to 1:1. Have each student use his or her own breathing barrier when doing rescue breathing on a manikin.\n\n\nFor actual resuscitation\n\nStress the need for and train with personal protective equipment (PPE) during resuscitation, as recommended by the CPR-certifying organization (such as the American Red Crossexternal icon), and use a bag-valve mask (BVM) with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. BVM ventilation is best delivered with two rescuers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWear a mask. Save lives.\n\nTeach and reinforce use of cloth masks\u00a0in public settings when around people you don\u2019t live with, particularly when it is difficult to maintain social distancing.\n\nAdvise people wearing masks to not wear them in the water. Cloth masks can be difficult to breathe through when they\u2019re wet. This means it is particularly important to maintain social distancing in the water. Plus, wet cloth masks don\u2019t slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks.\n\n\n\n\nCover coughs and sneezes\n\nTeach and reinforce covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands.\n\n\nWash hands often\n\nTeach and reinforce handwashing\u00a0with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after being in a public place or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\n\nUse hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if soap and water are not readily available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean and then disinfect\n\nCleaning with a household cleaner that contains soap or detergent reduces the amount of germs on surfaces and decreases risk of infection from surfaces. In most situations, cleaning alone removes most virus particles on surfaces. Disinfection to reduce spread of COVID-19 at home is likely not needed unless someone in your home is sick or someone with COVID-19 has been in your home within the last 24 hours.
